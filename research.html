           The Behavioural Ecology of Obligate Scavengers
        </h2>

        <p></p>
        <p> The main focus of my PhD was the ecology of obligate scavengers in the context of African vulture species. Throughout this project I developed expertise in theoretical modelling of foraging behaviour, in the plotting of empirical tracking data, and in applying these skills to animal conservation efforts. This work fit in well with the research themes of the <a href="http://www.tcd.ie/Zoology/research/research/theoretical/vultures.php">zoology department</a> at Trinity College Dublin.

The effect of supplementary feeding sites of vulture foraging behaviour</h2>


<!--  <p> &nbsp;</p>  -->
Identifying the areas animals use and how this varies across time is vital to conservation efforts esepcially in the case of wide-ranging vultures that traverse over international borders.

Scavenging in theropod dinosaurs
</h2>
<!-- <p> &nbsp;</p>  -->
 The enormous size and diversity of forms of Theropod dinosaurs raise many questions of how they survived in a world that bears little comparison to today’s ecosystems. In particular I am interested in what foraging behaviours they must have performed to meet their enormous energetic demands. One strategy theropods may have utilised is facultative scavenging.

<p></p>
This part of my research uses published estimates of theropod attributes and agent-based modelling approach’s to replicate theropods foraging in a range of potential possible environments. My research in this area has to date shown that facultative scavenging behaviours not only provide a significant resource in Mesozoic environments but, contrary to current thinking, such scavenging is most efficient at intermediate body sizes of around half a ton.These results mean that larger adult forms of Tyrannosaurus rex and its relatives were certainly not scavengers and more likely to have relied on active predation while other species such as Dilophosaurs and juvenile Tyrannosaurs were likely to have been effective scavengers, much like modern hyenas.
<p></p>
This modelling approach using an energetics-modelling approach at the level of the individual can allow a window into Earth’s ancient ecosystems, giving us a better understanding of the behaviour of some of the most enigmatic and iconic species of the Mesozoic.
