           The Behavioural Ecology of Obligate Scavengers
        </h2>

        <p></p>
        <p> The main focus of my PhD was the ecology of obligate scavengers in the context of African vulture species. Throughout this project I developed expertise in theoretical modelling of foraging behaviour, in the plotting of empirical tracking data, and in applying these skills to animal conservation efforts. This work fit in well with the research themes of the <a href="http://www.tcd.ie/Zoology/research/research/theoretical/vultures.php">zoology department</a> at Trinity College Dublin.

  <p> One of my ongoing projects with my colleagues in Swaziland is to track the movements of the Swazi population of African white-backed Vultures. There are approximately 300 breedings pairs in the country and we are using high resolution trackers to elucidate the movement of two birds. In the map here you can already see the huge ranges the birds cover. This displays data from 12th May - 30th June.

The effect of supplementary feeding sites on vulture foraging behaviour</h2>
<!--  <a href="http://tinypic.com?ref=v7s3td" target="_blank"><img src="http://i61.tinypic.com/v7s3td.jpg" border="0" alt="Image and video hosting by TinyPic"></a> -->

<!--  <p> &nbsp;</p>  -->
Supplementary feeding sites, aka vulture restaurants have been in use since the 70s to augment the diet of vultures in Southern Africa. But how such areas impact upon the natural foraging behaviours of these birds remains poorly understood. One of my current research projects is to get an insight into the effects, positive or negative that supplementary food has on vultures.  
Certainly, identifying the areas animals use and how this varies across time is vital to conservation efforts esepcially in the case of wide-ranging vultures that traverse over international borders. It seems probable that vulture restaurants could affect this.

Scavenging in theropod dinosaurs
</h2>
<!-- <p> &nbsp;</p>  -->
Obligate scavenging is a rare mode of life because it requires animals to search large areas to find enough food to sustain themselves. The carcasses on which they feed are typically unpredictable in space and time. That said, most 
species will scavenge facultatively. One of my research questions is to look at the extent of this behaviour in theropod dinosaurs. Along with my colleagues I'm modelling what drivers allow for different theropod species to take a significant amount of carrion in their diet.
