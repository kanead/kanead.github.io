           The Behavioural Ecology of Obligate Scavengers
        </h2>

        <p></p>
        <p> The main focus of my PhD was the ecology of obligate scavengers in the context of African vulture species. Throughout this project I developed expertise in theoretical modelling of foraging behaviour, in the plotting of empirical tracking data, and in applying these skills to animal conservation efforts. This work fit in well with the research themes of the <a href="http://www.tcd.ie/Zoology/research/research/theoretical/vultures.php">zoology department</a> at Trinity College Dublin.

The effect of supplementary feeding sites of vulture foraging behaviour</h2>


<!--  <p> &nbsp;</p>  -->
Supplementary feeding sites, aka vulture restaurants have been in use since the 70s to augment the diet of vultures in Southern Africa. But how these areas impact upon the natural foraging behaviours of these birds remains poorly understood. One of current my research projects is to get an insight into the effects, positive or negative that supplementary food has on vultures.  
Certainly, identifying the areas animals use and how this varies across time is vital to conservation efforts esepcially in the case of wide-ranging vultures that traverse over international borders. It seems probable that vulture restaurants could affect this.

Scavenging in theropod dinosaurs
</h2>
<!-- <p> &nbsp;</p>  -->
Obligate scavenging is a rare mode of life because it requires animals to search large areas to find enough food to sustain themselves. The carcasses on which they feed are typically unpredictable in space and time. That said, most 
species will scavenge facultatively. One of my research questions is to look at the extent of this behaviour in theropod dinosaurs. Along with my colleagues I'm modelling what drivers allow for different theropod species to take a significant amount of carrion in their diet.
